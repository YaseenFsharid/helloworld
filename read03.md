# helloworld
this a description revision and the cloud 
# there is three thing must to do when you wanna make a git file on your local pc and reflect the changes to the same file on git hub :
1- add the thing you wanna make change on it like this 
   * git remote add URL , _example_ : git remote add README.md
2- to make a commit for the update :
   * git commit -m “made change x,y,z”.
3- for pushing the update to the cloud :
   * git push original master 
   
## an i've learn on this class what is the head and the snapshot :
   _the head is the master snapshot and its the final commit so whole of these hold same meanings but each one of them have its own mean_
   
#### also i've learn the deffrance between git and github :
   *the big defferance between them is git let you change the content on the github cloud by your local pc desktop 
   and the github is the place where you save and share your work to the public and there is a way to connecting them by make the two file in the same name and controling them by the ACP techuiqe*
